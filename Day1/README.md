### Write an algorithm for accepting two numbers, divide the first number by second and display their quotient.

```
Step1 Start an algorithm
Step2 Declare variable a, b, c
Step3 Take first number and second number input and store in a and b respectively
Step4 Check if a is greater than or equal to b 
Step5 Calculate c= a/b 
Step6 Otherwise
Step7 Calculate c=b/a
Step8 Display c
Step9 End the algorithm

### Write an algorithm for accepting distance in kilometers, convert it into meters and display the result.

```
Step1 Start an algorithm
Step2 Declare variable a
Step3 Take distance in kilometers input and store in variable a
Step4 Calculate a= a*1000
Step5 Display a
Step6 End the algorithm

``` 
### Write an algorithm for accepting five numbers and display the sum and average of the numbers.

```
Step1 Start an algorithm
Step2 Declare a, sum=0, n=0, Average=0
Step3 Take number input and store in a
Step4 Calculate sum= sum+ a
Step5 Increment n by 1
Step6 Check if n< 5 go to step 3 otherwise go to next
Step7 Calculate Average = sum/5
Step8 Display sum
Step9 Display Average
Step10 End the algorithm

```
### Write an algorithm for accepting a number and display the whether it is odd or even.

```
Step1 Start an algorithm
Step2 Declare a
Step3 Take number input and store in a
Step4 check if a%2 == 0 then display number is even
Step5 otherwise display number is odd
Step6 End the algorithm

```

### Write an algorithm for accepting third character of the given string and then display whether it is vowel or constant.

```
Step1 Start an algorithm
Step2 Declare n=0
Step3 Declare char ch
Step4 Declare String Str
Step5 Take String input and store in Str
Step6 Store Str[n] to ch
Step7 Increment n by 1
Step8 Check if n != 3 go to Step6
Step9 Else go to Step10
Step10 Check if (Char ch=='a' || ch=='e' || ch=='i' || ch=='o' || ch=='u' ||  ch=='A' || ch=='E' || ch=='I' || ch=='O' || ch=='U' ) Display "it is vowel"
Step11 Else Display "It is constant"
Step12 End of the algorithm
